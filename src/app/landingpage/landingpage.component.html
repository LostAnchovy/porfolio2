        <h1 class="text-center siliconvalley">In the Land of the Purple Pumpkin Coders</h1>
        <p>Hi my name is Keith Nguyen and what makes me unique is that I am an eight armed purple pumpkin eater. OK ok I’m not!! But sometimes I wished that I had eight arms because it would make my love of design and programming so much easier!! One arm to code, one arm to debug, one arm to design and many arms for coffee!  And who doesn’t love pumpkin pie right? Unless that is you…then I was just kidding.</p>
        <p>So here is the thing. I love creating concepts and bringing it to life. There isn’t a greater satisfaction then to brining my ideas into fruition. Let me explain.
        </p>
        <p>If you stuck me in a room and told me to maintain and fix bugs, I would die a very painful death. It would truly be a sad sight. If you gave me a complex task, provided me support and gave me the freedom to create and solve the problem with my skills, in addition to unlimited coffee and pumpkin pie, I would make you proud. Us eight armed purple pumpkin eaters have high standards!!</p>
        <p>My more serious skill sets are listed below, but I’m more interesting in finding a development team that enjoys their work, supports their co-workers, and strives to innovate each and every day.</p>
        <p>In all honesty, I live by three basic rules. Stay humble, stay hungry and always stay ready. My tentacles are ready to code so what’s the next project?</p>

        <!-- <p>My journey into software development began at a very young age. My family settled into Silicon Valley and
            was part of the tech revolution after we were displaced during the Vietnam War. My father worked as a
            engineer and my mom a technician for a bio medical company. Like many families we struggled to adjust
            culturally and economically but worked hard everyday to make a better life for ourselves here.</p>
        <p>My dad taught me from a young age to build, tinker and play with computers. Our first computer was a pentium
            x486 built by hand before it became more economically prudent to buy computers prepackaged through large
            companies like dell.</p>
        <p>From a very young age I always enjoy tinkering with new technology, sometimes breaking them to find out how
            it works and putting them back together. Needless to say this became an expensive hobby, but "that"
            curiosity never left me, It is part of who I am. Love me or hate me, i break things to learn, but always
            strive to make them better!
        </p>
        <p>Many years later coding has become an off shoot from my creativity. Integrating design, User Interfaces, and
            code into a working product that others can use drives me everyday. I love the feeling of delivering a
            finish product to a client. It feels great to see a plan come together. Let's build something!</p> -->
